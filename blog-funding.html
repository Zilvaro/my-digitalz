                <h1 class="about-header">Why DigitalZ Funding</h1>
                <h4 id="about-subtitle">Let’s be clear: we understand there are a lot of crowdfunding platforms,
                    including ones of major social-media networks and financial institutions.</h4>
                <p>We have looked at most of them and identified where they excel and what they miss for the users to
                    benefit the most in their funding activities. Here are <span class="span-bold">7</span> main reasons
                    why we think DigitalZ is an excellent choice for you:</p><br>
                <ol class="article-ol">
                    <li><span class="span-bold">DigitalZ has continuous engagement with Your supporters. </span>It is
                        not limited in time or a project. You can communicate with different groups of friends,
                        partners, volunteers, donators for as long as you wish to continue your initiative.</li><br>
                    <li><span class="span-bold">DigitalZ is personalized for you. </span>The colours, layouts, content
                        give users the feeling they use your proprietary app. At the same time, you use the benefits of
                        being in a larger platform since donators from other sustainability communities have a chance
                        noticing your name and activities for support. </li><br>
                    <li><span class="span-bold">You receive all the donations. </span>There is no “All-or-nothing” rule
                        as in many other crowdfunding platforms when you receive the money if you exceed the set funding
                        objective or receive nothing.</li><br>
                    <li><span class="span-bold">DigitalZ is a free advertisement platform for your activities.
                        </span>You can continuously link videos, place sustainability workshops materials, product or
                        service descriptions, event advertisement or even the products on sale.</li><br>
                    <li><span class="span-bold">You can link it to the external sites or information. </span>You can
                        easily link the application to your e-shops, partners’ offers to enrich the proposals to your
                        supporters.</li><br>
                    <li><span class="span-bold">Notifications. </span>Your application is on the individual’s phone with
                        regular notifications and reminders about your activities. You can regulate the frequency and
                        context of the messages to different user groups of your application.</li><br>
                    <li><span class="span-bold">Chat or send some tasks to perform. </span>You may use the
                        crowd-engagement function to deliver the tasks to your team members, partners, influencers,
                        donators, volunteers and control the execution.</li><br><br>
                </ol>
                <p class="p-bold">So, if you want a continuous personalized engagement with your supporters to grow the
                    success of your initiative, DigitalZ shall be your aid!</p><br>
