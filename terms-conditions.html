                <p>These Terms of Use ("Agreement") set forth the general terms and conditions of your use of the
                    "DigitalZ" mobile application ("Mobile Application" or "Service") and any of its related products
                    and services (collectively, "Services"). By accessing and using the Mobile
                    Application and Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by
                    the terms of this Agreement. You acknowledge that this
                    Agreement is a contract between you and DigitalZ, even though it is electronic and is not physically
                    signed by you, and it governs your use of the Mobile Application and Services.</p><br><br>

                <h3 class="tc-subtitle">Creating Account</h3>
                <p>You must be at least 16 years of age to use the Mobile Application and Services. By using the Mobile
                    Application and Services and by agreeing to this Agreement you warrant and represent that you are at
                    least 16 years of age.<br>When you create an account in the Mobile Application, you are responsible
                    for maintaining the security of your account and you are fully responsible for all activities that
                    occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with it. We may, but have no
                    obligation to, monitor and review new accounts before you may sign in and start using the Services.
                    Providing false contact information of any kind may result in the termination of your account. You
                    must immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account or any other breaches of
                    security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind
                    incurred as a result of such acts or omissions. We may suspend, disable, or delete your account (or
                    any part thereof) if we determine that you have violated any provision of this Agreement or that
                    your conduct or content would tend to damage our reputation and goodwill. If we delete your account
                    for the foregoing reasons, you may not re-register for our Services. We may block your email address
                    and Internet protocol address to prevent further registration.
                </p><br><br>

                <h3 class="tc-subtitle">Cookies</h3>
                <p>We use cookies to operate and provide our Services, including to provide our Services that are
                    web-based, improve your experiences, understand how our Services are being used, and customise them.
                    Additionally, we may use cookies to remember your choices, like your language preferences, to
                    provide a safer experience, and otherwise to customise our Services for you. </p><br><br>

                <h3 class="tc-subtitle">Accuracy of information</h3>
                <p>Occasionally there may be information in the Mobile Application that contains typographical errors,
                    inaccuracies or omissions that may relate to product descriptions, pricing, availability, promotions
                    and offers. We reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions, and to change or
                    update information or cancel orders if any information in the Mobile Application or Services is
                    inaccurate at any time without prior notice (including after you have submitted your order). We
                    undertake no obligation to update, amend or clarify information in the Mobile Application including,
                    without limitation, pricing information, except as required by law. No specified update or refresh
                    date applied in the Mobile Application should be taken to indicate that all information in the
                    Mobile Application or Services has been modified or updated.</p><br><br>

                <h3 class="tc-subtitle">Links to other resources</h3>
                <p>Although the Mobile Application and Services may link to other resources (such as websites, mobile
                    applications, e-shops, etc.), we are not, directly or indirectly, implying any approval,
                    association, sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation with any linked resource, unless specifically
                    stated herein. Some of the links in the Mobile Application may be "affiliate links". We are not
                    responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any businesses or
                    individuals or the content of their resources. We do not assume any responsibility or liability for
                    the actions, products, services, and content of any other third parties. You should carefully review
                    the legal statements and other conditions of use of any resource which you access through a link in
                    the Mobile Application and Services. Your linking to any other off-site resources is at your own
                    risk.</p><br><br>

                <h3 class="tc-subtitle">Limitation of liability</h3>
                <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will DigitalZ, its affiliates,
                    employees, agents, suppliers or licensors be liable to any person for any indirect, incidental,
                    special, punitive, cover or consequential damages (including, without limitation, damages for lost
                    profits, revenue, sales, goodwill, use of content, impact on business, business interruption, loss
                    of anticipated savings, loss of business opportunity, etc.).</p><br><br>
