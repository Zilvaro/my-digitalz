                <h1 id="tc-header">Terms of Use</h1>
                <p>These Terms of Use ("Agreement") set forth the general terms and conditions of your use of the
                    "DigitalZ" mobile application ("Mobile Application" or "Service") and any of its related products
                    and services (collectively, "Services"). This Agreement is legally binding between you ("User",
                    "you" or "your") and DigitalZ ("DigitalZ", "we", "us" or "our"). By accessing and using the Mobile
                    Application and Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by
                    the terms of this Agreement. If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a business or
                    other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to this Agreement,
                    in which case the terms "User", "you" or "your" shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such
                    authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this Agreement, you must not accept this
                    Agreement and may not access and use the Mobile Application and Services. You acknowledge that this
                    Agreement is a contract between you and DigitalZ, even though it is electronic and is not physically
                    signed by you, and it governs your use of the Mobile Application and Services.</p><br><br>

                <h3 class="tc-subtitle">Creating Account</h3>
                <p>You must be at least 16 years of age to use the Mobile Application and Services. By using the Mobile
                    Application and Services and by agreeing to this Agreement you warrant and represent that you are at
                    least 16 years of age.<br>When you create an account in the Mobile Application, you are responsible
                    for maintaining the security of your account and you are fully responsible for all activities that
                    occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with it. We may, but have no
                    obligation to, monitor and review new accounts before you may sign in and start using the Services.
                    Providing false contact information of any kind may result in the termination of your account. You
                    must immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your account or any other breaches of
                    security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind
                    incurred as a result of such acts or omissions. We may suspend, disable, or delete your account (or
                    any part thereof) if we determine that you have violated any provision of this Agreement or that
                    your conduct or content would tend to damage our reputation and goodwill. If we delete your account
                    for the foregoing reasons, you may not re-register for our Services. We may block your email address
                    and Internet protocol address to prevent further registration.
                </p><br><br>

                <h3 class="tc-subtitle">Cookies</h3>
                <p>We use cookies to operate and provide our Services, including to provide our Services that are
                    web-based, improve your experiences, understand how our Services are being used, and customise them.
                    Additionally, we may use cookies to remember your choices, like your language preferences, to

                <h3 class="tc-subtitle">Accuracy of information</h3>
                <p>Occasionally there may be information in the Mobile Application that contains typographical errors,
                    inaccuracies or omissions that may relate to product descriptions, pricing, availability, promotions
                    and offers. We reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions, and to change or
                    update information or cancel orders if any information in the Mobile Application or Services is
                    inaccurate at any time without prior notice (including after you have submitted your order). We
                    undertake no obligation to update, amend or clarify information in the Mobile Application including,
                    without limitation, pricing information, except as required by law. No specified update or refresh
                    date applied in the Mobile Application should be taken to indicate that all information in the
                    Mobile Application or Services has been modified or updated.</p>
